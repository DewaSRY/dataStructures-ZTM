* Bog O Short heads 
1.Arithmetic operations are constant
2.Variable assignment is constant
3.Accessing elements in an array (by index) or object(by key) is constant 
4. in a loop the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside of the loop

/** Understand the Problem
 * 1 can i restate the problem in my own words
 * 2. what are the inputs that got into the problem
 * 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution

 * 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs ?
 * in other words, do i have enoughs information to solve
 * the problem ? (you might set about solving the problem
 * thats okay its still worth considering  the question at
 * this early stage)
 * 5. How should i label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem ?
